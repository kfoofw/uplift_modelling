# uplift_modelling

This is a repo that explores various uplift modelling packages on the [Criteo dataset](http://ailab.criteo.com/criteo-uplift-prediction-dataset/). 
- Note that the exact Criteo dataset is too large (3.2 GB) so it was not pushed into the repo.

Packages explored:
- [Pylift](https://pylift.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
